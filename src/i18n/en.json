Choosing the right weapons ensures you make the most of your Wardian’s stats and maximize their strengths in combat. Likewise, selecting a spirit that synergizes well with your Wardian’s attributes provides a significant advantage. In short, learning your Wardian’s strengths will allow you to equip them with what suits them best."
